### Project Title
Bikeshare Data *Python* Script

### Python Script to Explore US Bikeshare Data 
A Python script written for Project 2 of Nanodegree data science program at Udacity, sponsered by **AAL**(Africa). 
Its used to explore data related to bike share systems for the three cities including Chicago, New York City, and Washington. It imports data from csv files and compute descriptive statistics from the data. It also takes in users' raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
### How to run the script
You can run the script by install Python Anaconda, you will need to [download the Anaconda installer](https://www.anaconda.com/download/). This script is written in Python 3, so you will need the Python 3.x version of the installer. After downloading and installing **Anaconda**.
### Datasets
The datasets used for this script contain bike share data for the three cities of chicago, New york and Washington. . Some data wrangling has been performed by Udacity's staff before being provided to the students. I downloaded this files from the udacity project workspace. The file sizes are too big to be loaded at once, so on requesting to view the city data, i specified 7 columns each time a user requests to see the data.

The data is provided by [*Motivate*](https://www.motivateco.com/), which is a bike share system provider for many cities in the United States. The data files for all three cities contain the same six columns:
* Start Time
* End Time
* Trip Duration (in seconds)
* Start Station
* End Station
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also contain the following two columns:
* Gender
* Birth Year
